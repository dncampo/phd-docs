	abstract = {Nodes in real-world networks organize into densely linked communities where edges appear with high concentration among the members of the community. Identifying such communities of nodes has proven to be a challenging task due to a plethora of definitions of network communities, intractability of methods for detecting them, and the issues with evaluation which stem from the lack of a reliable gold-standard ground-truth. In this paper, we distinguish between structural and functional definitions of network communities. Structural definitions of communities are based on connectivity patterns, like the density of connections between the community members, while functional definitions are based on (often unobserved) common function or role of the community members in the network. We argue that the goal of network community detection is to extract functional communities based on the connectivity structure of the nodes in the network. We then identify networks with explicitly labeled functional communities to which we refer as ground-truth communities. In particular, we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration, and information networks where nodes explicitly state their community memberships. For example, in social networks, nodes explicitly join various interest-based social groups. We use such social groups to define a reliable and robust notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology, which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of communities correspond to ground-truth functional communities. We study 13 commonly used structural definitions of communities and examine their sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad participation ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that easily scales to networks with more than 100 million nodes. The proposed method achieves 30 \% relative improvement over current local clustering methods.},

We find that the EM algorithm significantly outperforms the other methods, and proceed to investigate the effect of various initialization methods on the final solution produced by the EM algorithm. The initializations that we consider are (1) parameters sampled from an uninformative prior, (2) random perturbations of the marginal distribution of the data, and (3) the output of agglomerative clustering. Although the methods are substantially different, they lead to learned models that are similar in quality.},

In this paper, we discuss the necessity of correction for chance for information theoretic based measures for clusterings comparison. We observe that the baseline for such measures, i.e. average value between random partitions of a data set, does not take on a constant value, and tends to have larger variation when the ratio between the number of data points and the number of clusters is small. This effect is similar in some other non-information theoretic based measures such as the well-known Rand Index. Assuming a hypergeometric model of randomness, we derive the analytical formula for the expected mutual information value between a pair of clusterings, and then propose the adjusted version for several popular information theoretic based measures. Some examples are given to demonstrate the need and usefulness of the adjusted measures.},

Unlike social networks (e.g., Flickr, Facebook) that have explicit groups for users to subscribe to or join, LBSNs usually have no explicit community structure. In order to capitalize on the large number of potential users, quality community detection and profiling approaches are needed. In the meantime, the diversity of people's interests and behaviors when using LBSNs suggests that their community structures overlap. In this paper, based on the user check-in traces at venues and user/venue attributes, we come out with a novel multimode multi-attribute edge-centric coclustering framework to discover the overlapping and hierarchical communities of LBSNs users. By employing both intermode and intramode features, the proposed framework is not only able to group like-minded users from different social perspectives but also discover communities with explicit profiles indicating the interests of community members. The efficacy of our approach is validated by intensive empirical evaluations using the collected Foursquare dataset.},

	abstract = {Network communities represent mesoscopic structure for understanding the organization of real-world networks, where nodes often belong to multiple communities and form overlapping community structure in the network. Due to non-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities, this problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort has been devoted to detect overlapping communities from the network.In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm for Overlapping Community detection), a two-stage framework to detect overlapping community structure. We build on a novel observation that non-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community detection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual overlapping community structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this observation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another overlapping community finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the output of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the required overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that by combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can suitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called permanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community memberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world networks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art overlapping community detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the output with the ground-truth structure. Thus our framework not only finds meaningful overlapping communities from the network, but also allows us to put an end to the constant effort of building yet another overlapping community detection algorithm.},

After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30\%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities.},

	abstract = {A cluster operator takes a set of data points and partitions the points into clusters (subsets). As with any scientific model, the scientific content of a cluster operator lies in its ability to predict results. This ability is measured by its error rate relative to cluster formation. To estimate the error of a cluster operator, a sample of point sets is generated, the algorithm is applied to each point set and the clusters evaluated relative to the known partition according to the distributions, and then the errors are averaged over the point sets composing the sample. Many validity measures have been proposed for evaluating clustering results based on a single realization of the random-point-set process. In this paper we consider a number of proposed validity measures and we examine how well they correlate with error rates across a number of clustering algorithms and random-point-set models. Validity measures fall broadly into three classes: internal validation is based on calculating properties of the resulting clusters; relative validation is based on comparisons of partitions generated by the same algorithm with different parameters or different subsets of the data; and external validation compares the partition generated by the clustering algorithm and a given partition of the data. To quantify the degree of similarity between the validation indices and the clustering errors, we use Kendall's rank correlation between their values. Our results indicate that, overall, the performance of validity indices is highly variable. For complex models or when a clustering algorithm yields complex clusters, both the internal and relative indices fail to predict the error of the algorithm. Some external indices appear to perform well, whereas others do not. We conclude that one should not put much faith in a validity score unless there is evidence, either in terms of sufficient data for model estimation or prior model knowledge, that a validity measure is well-correlated to the error rate of the clustering algorithm.},

Specifically, we first introduce the data distribution view of K-means, and the resultant uniform effect on highly imbalanced data sets. Eight external measures widely used in recent data mining tasks are also collected as candidates for K-means evaluation. Then, we demonstrate that only three measures, namely the variation of information (VI), the van Dongen criterion (VD) and the Mirkin metric (M), can detect the negative uniform effect of K-means in the clustering results. We also provide new normalization schemes for these three measures, i.e., VI norm ′ , VD norm ′ and M norm ′ , which enables the cross-data comparisons of clustering qualities. Finally, we explore some properties such as the consistency and sensitivity of the three measures, and give some advice on how to use them in K-means practice.},

Currently, there are too few measures for graph clusterings with overlaps available that would enable a meaningful evaluation, even though many well studied crisp quality measures exist. In order to expand the pool of overlapping measures we propose three methods to adapt existing crisp quality measures so that they can handle graph overlaps appropriately. We demonstrate our methods on the well known measures Density, Modularity and Conductance. We also propose an enhancement of an existing modularity measure for networks with overlapping structure. We analyse the proposed quality indices using experiments on artificial graphs that possess overlapping structure.

	abstract = {Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a well-studied model of fleshy fruit development and ripening. Tomato fruit development is well understood from a hormonal-regulatory perspective, and developmental changes in pigment and cell wall metabolism are also well characterized. However, more general aspects of metabolic change during fruit development have not been studied despite the importance of metabolism in the context of final composition of the ripe fruit. In this study, we quantified the abundance of a broad range of metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, analyzed a number of the principal metabolic fluxes, and in parallel analyzed transcriptomic changes during tomato fruit development. Metabolic profiling revealed pronounced shifts in the abundance of metabolites of both primary and secondary metabolism during development. The metabolite changes were reflected in the flux analysis that revealed a general decrease in metabolic activity during ripening. However, there were several distinct patterns of metabolite profile, and statistical analysis demonstrated that metabolites in the same (or closely related) pathways changed in abundance in a coordinated manner, indicating a tight regulation of metabolic activity. The metabolite data alone allowed investigations of likely routes through the metabolic network, and, as an example, we analyze the operational feasibility of different pathways of ascorbate synthesis. When combined with the transcriptomic data, several aspects of the regulation of metabolism during fruit ripening were revealed. First, it was apparent that transcript abundance was less strictly coordinated by functional group than metabolite abundance, suggesting that posttranslational mechanisms dominate metabolic regulation. Nevertheless, there were some correlations between specific transcripts and metabolites, and several novel associations were identified that could provide potential targets for manipulation of fruit compositional traits. Finally, there was a strong relationship between ripening-associated transcripts and specific metabolite groups, such as TCA-cycle organic acids and sugar phosphates, underlining the importance of the respective metabolic pathways during fruit development. },

	abstract = {Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

With the genome sequences of Arabidopsis and rice in hands, postgenomics studies integrating all "omics" sciences can depict precise pictures of a whole-cellular process. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first report of investigation for gene-to-metabolite networks regulating sulfur and nitrogen nutrition and secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis, with integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses were carried out, respectively, with DNA macroarray and several chemical analytical methods, including ultra high-resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron MS. Mathematical analyses, including principal component analysis and batch-learning self-organizing map analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data suggested the presence of general responses to sulfur and nitrogen deficiencies. In addition, specific responses to either sulfur or nitrogen deficiency were observed in several metabolic pathways: in particular, the genes and metabolites involved in glucosinolate metabolism were shown to be coordinately modulated. Understanding such gene-to-metabolite networks in primary and secondary metabolism through integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics can lead to identification of gene function and subsequent improvement of production of useful compounds in plants.},

	doi = {TPJ2865},
	abstract = {Hahb-4 is a member of the Helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily I of HD-Zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (TF) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. Here we show that this TF is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. Plants overexpressing Hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and Hahb-4 levels. Potential targets of Hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of Hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of this TF has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as ACO and SAM, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as ERF2 and ERF5. Expression studies in sunflower indicate that Hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. Expression of Hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (HA-ACOa and HA-ACOb). Transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of Hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. We propose that Hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.},

In view of remarkable technical advances in transcriptomics and metabolomics, integrated analysis of these ‘omics’ by data-mining informatics is an excellent tool for prediction and identification of gene function, particularly for genes involved in complicated metabolic pathways. The availability of Arabidopsis public transcriptome datasets containing data of {\textgreater}1000 microarrays reinforces the potential for prediction of gene function by transcriptome coexpression analysis. Here, we review the strategy of combining transcriptome and metabolome as a powerful technology for studying the functional genomics of model plants and also crop and medicinal plants. },

	abstract = {The advent of microarrays has attracted considerable interest from biologists due to the potential for high throughput analysis of hundreds of thousands of gene transcripts. Subsequent analysis of the data may identify specific features which correspond to characteristics of interest within the population, for example, analysis of gene expression profiles in cancer patients to identify molecular signatures corresponding with prognostic outcome. These high throughput technologies have resulted in an unprecedented rate of data generation, often of high complexity, highlighting the need for novel data analysis methodologies that will cope with data of this nature. Stepwise methods using artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been developed to identify an optimal subset of predictive gene transcripts from highly dimensional microarray data. Here these methods have been applied to a gene microarray dataset to identify and validate gene signatures corresponding with estrogen receptor and lymph node status in breast cancer. Many gene transcripts were identified whose expression could differentiate patients to very high accuracies based upon firstly whether they were positive or negative for estrogen receptor, and secondly whether metastasis to the axillary lymph node had occurred. A number of these genes had been previously reported to have a role in cancer. Significantly fewer genes were used compared to other previous studies. The models using the optimal gene subsets were internally validated using an extensive random sample cross-validation procedure and externally validated using a follow up dataset from a different cohort of patients on a newer array chip containing the same and additional probe sets. Here, the models retained high accuracies, emphasising the potential power of this approach in analysing complex systems. These findings show how the proposed method allows for the rapid analysis and subsequent detailed interrogation of gene expression signatures to provide a further understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that could be important in determining novel prognostic markers associated with cancer.

	abstract = {Total soluble solids content is a key determinant of tomato fruit quality for processing. Several tomato lines carrying defined introgressions from S. pennellii in a S. lycopersicum background produce fruit with elevated Brix, a refractive index measure of soluble solids. The genetic basis for this trait can be determined by fine-mapping each QTL to a single gene, but this is time-consuming and technically demanding. As an alternative, high-throughput analytical technologies can be used to provide useful information that helps characterize molecular changes in the introgression lines. This paper presents a study of transcriptomic changes in six introgression lines with increased fruit Brix. Each line also showed altered patterns of fruit carbohydrate accumulation. Transcriptomic changes in fruit at 20 d after anthesis (DAA) were assessed using a 12 000-element EST microarray and significant changes analysed by SAM (significance analysis of microarrays). Each non-overlapping introgression resulted in a unique set of transcriptomic changes with 78\% of significant changes being unique to a single line. Principal components analysis allowed a clear separation of the six lines, but also revealed evidence of common changes; lines with quantitatively similar increases in Brix clustered together. A detailed examination of genes encoding enzymes of primary carbon metabolism demonstrated that few of the known introgressed alleles were altered in expression at the 20 DAA time point. However, the expression of other metabolic genes did change. Particularly striking was the co-ordinated up-regulation of enzymes of sucrose mobilization and respiration that occurred only in the two lines with the highest Brix increase. These common downstream changes suggest a similar mechanism is responsible for large Brix increases. },
